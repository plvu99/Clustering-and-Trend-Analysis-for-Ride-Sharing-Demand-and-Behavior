# 🚘 Clustering and Trend Analysis for Ride-Sharing Demand and Behavior

## ⚠️ Business Problem

Any company that facilitates transactions between counterparties commonly faces a matching problem—aligning supply with demand across two or more sides. For example, Uber often encounters situations where riders request trips but no nearby drivers are available, highlighting a gap in real-time supply-demand matching.

Even if riders and drivers are not that far away, if users have to **wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked up**, then they will likely cancel their ride's pickup request. Uber's research shows that users have **a willingness-to-wait time of 5-7 minutes**.

To improve rider experience and operational efficiency, it is critical for Uber to develop a system that can dynamically recommend hot-spot zones for drivers in major cities. These zones must account for fluctuations across days of the week and intraday hours to optimize rider-driver matching.

## 🧩 Objective Question

_**How can Uber identify and recommend dynamic hot-spot zones for drivers—based on temporal and spatial patterns—to reduce wait times and prevent cancellations?**_

The dataset contains over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014. [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F57P2xw9eCXcRggkbi00r7GnYDFh1iHZ/view?usp=sharing)

## 🧮 Proposed Solution

Use **clustering algorithms** to group pickup locations and define these clusters as hotspot zones where drivers should be encouraged to hang around.

- Analyze historical pickup data

- Apply clustering to identify high-demand zones

- Assign each new rider request to the nearest cluster

> Rider-pickup clusters serve as the basis for a matching rule: when a rider makes a request, the system assigns it to a cluster and broadcasts the request to all available drivers within that zone, increasing the likelihood of a fast, successful match.
